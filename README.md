Rune Swiss Army Knife for Liber Primus
 Here’s a summary of its functionalities:

Transliteration: Converts text from Elder Futhark runes to English and vice versa.
Atbash Cipher: Decrypts text encrypted with the Atbash cipher, which is a substitution cipher with a fixed letter mapping.
Caesar Cipher: Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
Vigenère Cipher: Decrypts text encrypted with the Vigenère cipher, which uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter.
Playfair Cipher: Encrypts and decrypts text using the Playfair cipher, which encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), making it more difficult to break than traditional single-letter substitution ciphers.
Brute Force Decryption: Attempts to decrypt text by trying various decryption methods with prime number shifts and user-provided keys or keywords.
Coherence Checks: Includes two separate checks for English coherence—one for the direct transliteration and one for the decrypted texts from brute force attempts—to ensure the output is understandable in English.
The script also provides a user interface that prompts the user to choose an operation from the listed cryptographic functions and enter the necessary information for the chosen operation. It’s designed to be a versatile tool for anyone interested in cryptography, particularly in the context of historical rune scripts.
